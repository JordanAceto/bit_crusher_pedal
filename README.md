stm32 based bitcrusher as a going away present for Ken

main pcb is pretty well along, but not finished

front panel and jack plate file structure is in place, but they are not started yet
firmware is not started yet

Controls: bit-depth, sample-rate, gain

Guitar pedal 1-spot style DC power

2 1/4" jacks for moog style expression pedal inputs, for bits & rate

fits in a hammond BB type box

3P2T true bypass stomp switch with LED indicator

clipping LED indicator driven by the uc

want it to look nice, maybe pcbs for front panel/jack panel?

Need to buy:
- hammond BB box
- stomp switch
- mouser parts
- pcb fab
- if I do a jack panel, get long shaft 1/4" receptacles
