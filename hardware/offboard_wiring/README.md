# Offboard wiring

![](bit_crusher_offboard_wiring.png)

This directory simply contains a wiring diagram for the offboard components that
are wired to the main pcb with flying wires.

These components are:
- signal input and signal output jacks
- 9vdc power input jack
- bypass switch
- fx on/off indicator LED
- bit-depth and sample-rate CV input/expression pedal jacks

The builder is free to chose jacks, switches, and LEDs that work well for their
chosen enclosure.
